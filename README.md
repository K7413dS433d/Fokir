# Fokir


## Overview

Fokir is a simple portfolio developed as part of my first project with Route Company. It showcases a clean design using HTML and CSS, with minimal JavaScript utilized solely for the navigation bar. The project highlights fundamental web development skills and provides a foundation for future, more complex projects.
