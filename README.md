# Fokir


## Overview

Fokir is a simple portfolio developed as part of my first project with Route Academy. It showcases a clean design using HTML and CSS, with minimal JavaScript utilized solely for the navigation bar. The project highlights fundamental web development skills and provides a foundation for future, more complex projects.

## Technology Used

- **HTML**: Structure and content of the website.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout of the website.
